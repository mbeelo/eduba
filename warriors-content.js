  { path: 'warriors', title: 'Victory, Not Lengthy Campaigns', author: 'Sun Tzu', content: 'In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns. Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people\'s fate.', difficulty_order: 7 },
  { path: 'warriors', title: 'Being Feared and Loved', author: 'Niccolò Machiavelli', content: 'Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with.', difficulty_order: 8 },
  { path: 'warriors', title: 'Customs and Rivers', author: 'Julius Caesar', content: 'All these differ from each other in language, customs and laws. The river Garonne separates the Gauls from the Aquitani; the Marne and the Seine separate them from the Belgae.', difficulty_order: 9 },

  { path: 'warriors', title: 'Five Factors of War', author: 'Sun Tzu', content: 'The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one\'s deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field. These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The Commander; (5) Method and discipline.', difficulty_order: 11 },
  { path: 'warriors', title: 'Supreme Excellence Without Fighting', author: 'Sun Tzu', content: 'Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy\'s resistance without fighting. Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy\'s troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.', difficulty_order: 12 },
  { path: 'warriors', title: 'A Slow River and a Sudden Strike', author: 'Julius Caesar', content: 'There is a river called the Saone, which flows through the territories of the Aedui and Sequani into the Rhone with such incredible slowness, that it can not be determined by the eye in which direction it flows. This the Helvetii were crossing by rafts and boats joined together. When Caesar was informed by spies that the Helvetii had already conveyed three parts of their forces across that river, but that the fourth part was left behind on this side of the Saone, he set out from the camp with three legions during the third watch, and came up with that division which had not yet crossed the river.', difficulty_order: 13 },
  { path: 'warriors', title: 'A Pattern to Others', author: 'Thucydides', content: 'Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighbouring states; we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves. Its administration favours the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if to social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit.', difficulty_order: 14 },
  { path: 'warriors', title: 'Cruelty Properly Used', author: 'Niccolò Machiavelli', content: 'Some may wonder how it can happen that Agathocles, and his like, after infinite treacheries and cruelties, should live for long secure in his country, and defend himself from external enemies, and never be conspired against by his own citizens. I believe that this follows from severities being badly or properly used. Those may be called properly used, if of evil it is possible to speak well, that are applied at one blow and are necessary to one\'s security, and that are not persisted in afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantage of the subjects.', difficulty_order: 15 },
  { path: 'warriors', title: 'Forecasting Victory or Defeat', author: 'Sun Tzu', content: 'These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail. Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this wise: (1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law? (2) Which of the two generals has most ability? (3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? (4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced? (5) Which army is stronger? (6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained? (7) In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment? By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat.', difficulty_order: 16 },
  { path: 'warriors', title: 'The Sicilian Expedition: Hopes and Strength', author: 'Thucydides', content: 'So thoroughly had the present prosperity persuaded the citizens that nothing could withstand them, and that they could achieve what was possible and impracticable alike, with means ample or inadequate it mattered not. The secret of this was their general extraordinary success, which made them confuse their strength with their hopes.', difficulty_order: 17 },
  { path: 'warriors', title: 'Fire to the Towns', author: 'Julius Caesar', content: 'After his death, the Helvetii nevertheless attempt to do that which they had resolved on, namely, to go forth from their territories. When they thought that they were at length prepared for this undertaking, they set fire to all their towns, in number about twelve - to their villages about four hundred - and to the private dwellings that remained; they burn up all the corn, except what they intend to carry with them; that after destroying the hope of a return home, they might be the more ready for undergoing all dangers. They order every one to carry forth from home for himself provisions for three months, ready ground.', difficulty_order: 18 },
  { path: 'warriors', title: 'Feared, Not Hated', author: 'Niccolò Machiavelli', content: 'Upon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Nevertheless a prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he does not win love, he avoids hatred; because he can endure very well being feared whilst he is not hated.', difficulty_order: 19 },
  { path: 'warriors', title: 'A Cause Kept Out of Sight', author: 'Thucydides', content: 'To the question why they broke the treaty, I answer by placing first an account of their grounds of complaint and points of difference, that no one may ever have to ask the immediate cause which plunged the Hellenes into a war of such magnitude. The real cause I consider to be the one which was formally most kept out of sight. The growth of the power of Athens, and the alarm which this inspired in Lacedaemon, made war inevitable. Still it is well to give the grounds alleged by either side which led to the dissolution of the treaty and the breaking out of the war.', difficulty_order: 20 },
  { path: 'warriors', title: 'War Drains a Nation', author: 'Sun Tzu', content: 'When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming, then men\'s weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be damped. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength. Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain. Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardor damped, your strength exhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue. Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays. There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare.', difficulty_order: 21 },
  { path: 'warriors', title: 'Do the Necessary Injuries Once', author: 'Niccolò Machiavelli', content: 'Hence it is to be remarked that, in seizing a state, the usurper ought to examine closely into all those injuries which it is necessary for him to inflict, and to do them all at one stroke so as not to have to repeat them daily; and thus by not unsettling men he will be able to reassure them, and win them to himself by benefits. He who does otherwise, either from timidity or evil advice, is always compelled to keep the knife in his hand; neither can he rely on his subjects, nor can they attach themselves to him, owing to their continued and repeated wrongs. For injuries ought to be done all at one time, so that, being tasted less, they offend less; benefits ought to be given little by little, so that the flavour of them may last longer.', difficulty_order: 22 },
  { path: 'warriors', title: 'A Wall and a Trench', author: 'Julius Caesar', content: 'Meanwhile, with the legion which he had with him and the soldiers which had assembled from the Province, he carries along for nineteen Roman, not quite eighteen English miles a wall, to the height of sixteen feet, and a trench, from the Lake of Geneva, which flows into the river Rhone, to Mount Jura, which separates the territories of the Sequani from those of the Helvetii. When that work was finished, he distributes garrisons, and closely fortifies redoubts, in order that he may the more easily intercept them, if they should attempt to cross over against his will. When the day which he had appointed with the embassadors came, and they returned to him; he says, that he can not, consistently with the custom and precedent of the Roman people, grant any one a passage through the Province; and he gives them to understand, that, if they should attempt to use violence he would oppose them.', difficulty_order: 23 },
  { path: 'warriors', title: 'The Melian Dialogue: What Is Feasible', author: 'Thucydides', content: 'For ourselves, we shall not trouble you with specious pretences—either of how we have a right to our empire because we overthrew the Mede, or are now attacking you because of wrong that you have done us—and make a long speech which would not be believed; and in return we hope that you, instead of thinking to influence us by saying that you did not join the Lacedaemonians, although their colonists, or that you have done us no wrong, will aim at what is feasible, holding in view the real sentiments of us both; since you know as well as we do that right, as the world goes, is only in question between equals in power, while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must. We recommend that you should try to get what it is possible for you to get, and avoid suffering what it is possible for you to avoid; and we shall not be willing to be turned aside from our path by arguments about justice, when the question is not between equals.', difficulty_order: 24 },
  { path: 'warriors', title: 'Attack by Stratagem (Supreme Excellence)', author: 'Sun Tzu', content: 'Sun Tzu said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy\'s country whole; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. So, too, it is better to capture an army than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.\n\nHence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy\'s resistance without fighting.\n\nThus the highest form of generalship is to baulk the enemy\'s plans; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy\'s forces; the next in order is to attack the enemy\'s army in the field; and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.\n\nTherefore the skilful leader subdues the enemy\'s troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.\n\nWith his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and without losing a man his triumph will be complete. This is the method of attacking by stratagem.\n\nIt is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy\'s one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two. If equally matched, we can offer battle; if inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.', difficulty_order: 25 },
