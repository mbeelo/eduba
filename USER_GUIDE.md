## The Three-Phase Training Process

### Phase 1: Study
**Duration**: Take your time to understand
**Goal**: Comprehension before memorization

**What to do**:
- Read the passage carefully multiple times
- Understand the meaning and context
- Note the logical flow of ideas
- Identify key phrases and transitions
- Don't rush to memorization

**Tips**:
- Read aloud to hear the rhythm
- Look up unfamiliar words
- Consider the author's intent
- Note literary devices or rhetorical techniques

### Phase 2: Practice
**Duration**: The core memorization work
**Goal**: Accurate recall from memory

**How it works**:
- The passage is hidden from view
- Type or speak the text from memory
- Real-time feedback shows accuracy
- Errors are highlighted immediately
- Complete the entire passage correctly

**Input Methods**:
- **Text Input**: Type on keyboard (default)
- **Voice Input**: Speak the passage (when supported)

**Feedback System**:
- Green highlights: Correct text
- Red highlights: Errors or omissions
- Real-time accuracy percentage
- Immediate error correction

### Phase 3: Review
**Duration**: Quick analysis and reflection
**Goal**: Learning from the practice session

**What you'll see**:
- Final accuracy percentage
- Time taken to complete
- Number of attempts required
- Common error patterns
- Progress toward mastery

**Next Steps**:
- Perfect accuracy: Move to next passage
- Need improvement: Repeat practice phase
- Partial completion: Resume from where you left off

## Memory Training Techniques

### Active Recall
**Principle**: Retrieving information from memory strengthens neural pathways
**Application**: Type out passages completely from memory
**Benefits**: Builds lasting retention, not temporary recognition

**Best Practices**:
- No peeking at the original text
- Complete the entire passage in one session
- Focus on accuracy over speed
- Don't rely on autocomplete or suggestions

### Spaced Repetition
**Principle**: Review material at increasing intervals for long-term retention
**Application**: Return to passages after days or weeks
**Benefits**: Moves knowledge from short-term to long-term memory

**How Eduba implements this**:
- Passages are available for re-practice
- System tracks your historical performance
- Recommendations based on forgetting curves
- Gradual interval increases

### Progressive Difficulty
**Principle**: Build skills gradually from simple to complex
**Application**: Passages are ordered by difficulty within each path
**Benefits**: Steady skill development without frustration

**Progression Structure**:
1. Short, simple phrases (5-10 words)
2. Medium sentences (20-30 words)
3. Paragraph-length passages (50+ words)
4. Complex texts with advanced vocabulary

## Maximizing Your Practice

### Daily Practice Routine

**Recommended Schedule**:
- **Minimum**: 5 minutes daily
- **Optimal**: 15-20 minutes daily

## Advanced Techniques

### Chunking Strategy
**Method**: Break long passages into logical segments
**Application**: Master 2-3 lines at a time, then combine
**Benefits**: Reduces cognitive load and improves success rate

### Rhythm and Flow
**Method**: Pay attention to natural speech patterns
**Application**: Practice reading aloud before memorization
**Benefits**: Rhythm aids memory and improves fluency

### Visualization
**Method**: Create mental images for abstract concepts
**Application**: Picture scenes or concepts described in text
**Benefits**: Multiple memory pathways strengthen recall

### Contextual Understanding
**Method**: Learn the historical and cultural context
**Application**: Research authors and time periods
**Benefits**: Meaning-based memory is more durable
